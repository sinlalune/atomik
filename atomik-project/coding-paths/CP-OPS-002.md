# CP-OPS-002 — Cairn 2.0

> **ACTIVATED 2026-08-24** after the owner ruled all eight decisions in the opening check
> ([session note](../sessions/2026-08-24-cp-ops-002-opening-check.md), agenda in
> [`docs/cairn/cairn-opening-check-agenda.md`](../../docs/cairn/cairn-opening-check-agenda.md)).
> Registered at `base_commit: 7aa3b1d` before its worktree branched.

## Why this path exists

The audit record — `docs/cairn/cairn-audit-2026-08-24.md` — found one failure mode
wearing six faces: **Cairn writes rules forward and never drains the state that predates
them.** Three checks currently report `OK` over conditions that are false on this trunk.

Ordering follows severity, not narrative. Enforcement integrity came first, because every
later step lands through the gates that were not gating — S00 adopted the four mechanical
repairs and S01 closed the schema and doctrine drift around them. What remains is the
ledger boundary, the OKF backfill, portability, and the greenfield pilot.

## Steps

#### Completed steps — rolled to `history/`, verbatim

Rolled at S07c and again at S07g, both times when `ledger-size` fired on this file. The
move is cut-and-paste, never a summary: each record below reads exactly as it did here.
Convention: [paths.md](./paths.md#the-ledger-has-a-boundary) · index:
[history/](./history/index.md).

- **[S00](./history/CP-OPS-002-S00.md)** — Adopt the local repairs — the four enforcement repairs, and how they landed
- **[S01](./history/CP-OPS-002-S01.md)** — Schema and doctrine fixes — the ceremony schema pinned, ADR-016
- **[S03](./history/CP-OPS-002-S03.md)** — Drain the grandfather set — owner-ruled, withdrawn
- **[S04](./history/CP-OPS-002-S04.md)** — Bound the ledger — the history/ rollup convention and advisory ledger-size
- **[S05](./history/CP-OPS-002-S05.md)** — Backfill OKF — indexes, ADR frontmatter, the gated opening check, logs everywhere
- **[S06](./history/CP-OPS-002-S06.md)** — Retire the drifted page, declare the enforcement tier, bind the audit, drain the leftovers
- **[S07a](./history/CP-OPS-002-S07a.md)** — ADR-017, the path lifecycle *(ruling 5, F11 + F15)* — **COMPLETE**
- **[S07](./history/CP-OPS-002-S07.md)** — Specification, lexicon, and the primer that makes them readable — **SUPERSEDED by S07c**
- **[S07b](./history/CP-OPS-002-S07b.md)** — The rendered page — **SUPERSEDED by S07c**
- **[S07c](./history/CP-OPS-002-S07c.md)** — Redo: one handbook, universal, in its own theme *(owner correction)* — **SUPERSEDED by S07e**
- **[S07d](./history/CP-OPS-002-S07d.md)** — The binding names, and the document read downward *(owner, 2026-08-25)* — **SUPERSEDED by S07e**
- **[S07e](./history/CP-OPS-002-S07e.md)** — Canonical top-down specification project and universal reader *(owner correction)* — **COMPLETE**

- **[S07f](./history/CP-OPS-002-S07f.md)** — Candidate-bound closure and truthful team lifecycle — COMPLETE
- **[S07g](./history/CP-OPS-002-S07g.md)** — Cairn v0.2: close the gaps between the promises and the predicates — COMPLETE
- **[S07h](./history/CP-OPS-002-S07h.md)** — The v0.2 predicates, part one: the parser, the typed ledger, and the two P0 gates — COMPLETE
- **[S07i](./history/CP-OPS-002-S07i.md)** — The v0.2 predicates, part two: the record rules — COMPLETE
- **[S07j](./history/CP-OPS-002-S07j.md)** — The v0.2 predicates, part three: routes, the brief contract, redaction — COMPLETE
- **[S07k](./history/CP-OPS-002-S07k.md)** — Repair: a retention ref was moved, and the rule could not see it — COMPLETE
- **[S07l](./history/CP-OPS-002-S07l.md)** — Repair: the brief could not name its own commit — COMPLETE

### S07m — Review round two: two unsound predicates and a fabricated figure — **COMPLETE**

```cairn-unit
step: S07m
unit: 09
type: implementation
verified: cairn-check, cairn-check:test, typecheck, test, build
```

The reviewer checked the response against the generated specification rather than taking it
at its word, and found four things. Three were defects in this work; one was a compliment
that does not survive counting.

- **`closure-surface` was more permissive than the prose it enforces.** The rule allowed
  `current_step` and `resolution` on any closure. `resolution` at closure is incoherent —
  a `ready` path has resolved nothing — and neither field appears in the normative list.
  The surface is now scoped by the fact being recorded: `ready` may move `status` and
  `subject_commit`; `done` additionally moves `resolution`, because that is the trunk
  integration unit. This was the exact seam the document claims to track, and the predicate
  was on the wrong side of it.
- **`advisory-disposition` was unsound, not merely partial.** It compared dispositions
  against the advisories raised while evaluating `A` — and `A` is field-restricted by
  construction, so its advisory set is a strict SUBSET of `C`'s. The rule could pass while
  an advisory raised at the candidate went undisposed, which is the failure the requirement
  exists to prevent. The closing record now **attests** `advisories_at_candidate`, bound to
  `C` by the audit's subject; dispositions must cover that set exactly, and any advisory
  that fires at `A` and is missing from it proves the attestation incomplete. An advisory
  firing only at `C` remains attested rather than derived, and the matrix says so.
- **Item 14 was conformance-breaking, not editorial.** The text disowned "forty hexadecimal
  characters" while the checker matched `[0-9a-f]{40}` in five places, so a SHA-256
  repository conformed to the specification and failed the reference tool — the tool and the
  spec disagreeing about what a valid repository is. `isObjectId` now accepts either format
  and refuses every prefix; `isCommitPin` widens to 64.
- **`route` gained a structural backstop.** Two of five triggers are self-declared, whose
  honest failure mode is that everything declares itself lightweight and no rule ever fires.
  *Expected* to span more than one work unit is unobservable; **having** spanned one is a
  fact in the ledger. A path whose ledger declares more than one `cairn-unit` must be
  `full`. It is the same trigger one unit late, and it cannot be declared away.
- **A fabricated figure, removed.** The response document reported v0.1 conformance as
  `9 / 0 / 21`. The real count is `6 / 1 / 8` across 15 rows — v0.1 shipped fifteen rows and
  at least one partial, so zero partials was impossible on its face. The number was not
  mis-transcribed; it was invented. It is now generated from the v0.1 table rather than
  asserted.
- **A compliment declined.** The reviewer read the split as surface area falling —
  "45 Cairn concepts, down from ~55". Classifying v0.1's 65 articles under the same
  taxonomy gives **41 Cairn and 24 borrowed**, so Cairn concepts went **41 → 45, up four**,
  while borrowed fell 24 → 21. The brief's "~25 real ideas" was an estimate; the split
  revealed the real number rather than reducing it. Accepting a flattering figure that
  counting contradicts is the failure this whole path exists to remove.
- **The failure mode both violations share is now named in the specification**, in a section
  addressed to the next implementer: a predicate can ask about a **declaration** or about a
  **fact**, the two read almost identically, and they diverge exactly when something has
  gone wrong — because a broken state usually leaves the declarations internally consistent.
  A moved ref keeps every declared unit resolving; a closure commit's advisory set stays a
  tidy subset. When a predicate can be written either way, write the one that can disagree
  with the record.
- Nine regression tests; checker suite 129 → 135, full suite 176 → 184. **No new rules** —
  every change corrects or scopes an existing one.

### S08 — Extract Cairn from Atomik

Cairn is not portable today: `cairn-check.mjs` hardcodes `atomik-project/`, `apps/`,
`AREA_MAP`, and the grandfather set.

- `cairn.config.json` — plane roots, source roots, area map, trunk name, and
  `"enforcement": "local" | "ci" | "protected"` (S06b).
- `cairn-check` prints the declared tier in its header line, so "CI observes" versus "CI
  prevents" is generated from the repository rather than written into prose that drifts.
- `tools/cairn-new.mjs` — registration commit and worktree in one command, so the
  registration precondition stops depending on memory.
- `cairn-init` seed template + the ex-nihilo bootstrap prompt. It scaffolds **tiers 0 and
  1 only**: the validator, the config, the docs skeleton and the workflow file. No host
  configuration, no account, nothing to click — adoption must not require someone else's
  web UI.

### S09 — Greenfield pilot, coherence audit, closing ceremony, self-merge

Initialize one real ex-nihilo repository from the kit — the research-paper workspace the
brief names — and fix what the pilot finds before merging.

## Documentation coverage

**Required:** `paths.md`, bedrock 22/24/26/35, ADR-009, ADR-012,
`docs/cairn/cairn-audit-2026-08-24.md`.
**Conditional:** bedrock 17 (self-evolving docs) at S07; ADR-011 at S05.
**Deliberately excluded:** all `apps/` module notes — this path writes no product code.

## Work Ledger

| Field | Value |
| :-- | :-- |
| Status | `running` on `path/cp-ops-002` |
| Base commit | `7aa3b1d` — registered on the trunk by `df875e6` before this branch existed |
| Branch | `path/cp-ops-002`, worktree `../4tom1k-cp-ops-002`, `node_modules` symlinked |
| Steps complete | **S00** — enforcement repairs adopted (`dd6e76a`) · **S01** — ceremony schema pinned, D1 corrected, registration doctrine unified, ADR-016 (`c4a9670`) · **S04** — ledger boundary, CP-MVP-008 rolled into `history/`, advisory `ledger-size` (`7e04288`) · **S05** — five indexes, ADR frontmatter, schema validation over the decision plane (`3df9073`) · **S05b** — the opening check gated, five more indexes (`d6b29f1`), the invented folder-log decision retracted on owner correction (`360f2be`) · **S05c** — the OKF pair completed: eighteen folder logs seeded from real Git history (`468bc24`) · **S06** — `index.html` rewritten against ADR-012, both HTML pages dated (`2a5ef35`) · **S06c** — the coherence audit bound to the commits its path contributed (`de4e0fa`) · **S06d** — the six stale worktrees and the orphan registration branch drained, `isFilled()` given something to measure, and a C-quoted path stopped hiding from the blocking rules (`9cbe605`, `6fa33e7`) · **S07a** — ADR-017 settles the path lifecycle; `active` retired, abandonment given a door, staleness noticed without blocking (`b4ef361`) · **S07 / S07b / S07c / S07d** — superseded specification attempts retained in this ledger · **S07e** — one canonical top-down specification project, linked newcomer foundations and implementation references, plus one self-contained three-pane universal reader · **S07f** — candidate-bound closure, truthful team lifecycle, the canonical concept wiki and the deterministic equal-pane universal reader, passed by the user and landed as its own checkpoint · **S07g** — the Cairn v0.2 revision: nineteen review items resolved in normative text, concept budget held at 66, ADR-019 proposed |
| Remaining | S08 and S09 (S03 withdrawn by owner ruling; S06b rescoped across S07 + S08 by ruling 9). S08 now also owns the v0.2 predicates: fourteen conformance rows say `not implemented` on purpose |
| Opening check | accepted 2026-08-24, eight rulings ([note](../sessions/2026-08-24-cp-ops-002-opening-check.md)) |
| Gates at S07e | `cairn-check` OK (1 advisory: no coherence audit for this head, expected before merge) · validator suite 90/90 · canonical catalogue generator current · HTML structure parser-validated · self-contained/targets/rules/inline-script contracts test-pinned · `npm run typecheck` PASS · product suite 1,101 passed / 1 skipped (1,102 total) · `npm run build` PASS |
| Ledger rolled (S07c) | `ledger-size` fired at ~11 k tokens against the 10 k budget while this file was being edited — which is the only moment the rule is useful, and it worked. S00, S01, S03, S04, S05 (+S05b, S05c) and S06 (+S06b, S06c, S06d) moved **verbatim** into [`history/`](./history/index.md), leaving one index line each. Verified by extracting each record's body and confirming it appears unchanged in `HEAD`. Two mechanical adjustments are named in every record header rather than made silently: deixis is left alone, and relative-link depth is repointed one level, because a link is an address rather than content and the same target must keep resolving |
| Scope note | protocol tooling and doctrine only; no product code changed. The full `typecheck`, product `test`, and production `build` gates were nevertheless run and passed at the completed-step boundary |
| Widening | `writes:` gained `atomik-project/briefs/cp-ops-002-handoff.md` at S01 — the per-step handoff brief is required by bedrock 22 and the original declaration simply omitted it. **Widened again at S06d** to `atomik-project/briefs/**`: F7's residue lives in that folder, and `scope-drift` said so the moment the owner ruled on `feedback on  MVP-001.md`. Recorded here and kept going, which is what `paths.md` asks of a widening |
| Widening (S07e) | `writes:` gained `tools/cairn-spec.test.mjs`: the universal reader's tree, contextual-note bindings, embedded rule catalogue and inline interaction code need an executable contract, and the original declaration could not name a file invented by this correction |
| Candidate (S07f) | **Passed by the user on 2026-08-26 and landed.** Implements exact-candidate audit/acceptance, `ready` versus trunk `done`, transition and registration-parent comparison, fail-closed inconclusive gates, forward-scoped immutable records, canonical/unique path identity, live blocked/ready projection, full-hash audit names, all guarded source roots, the canonical concept wiki/reference project, and the deterministic equal-pane universal reader. Cairn remains team-oriented, path-self-integrating through a declared transport, and remotely resumable at every completed checkpoint |
| Gates at complete S07f candidate | `npm run cairn-check:test` PASS, 118 protocol/specification subtests · generated Markdown and HTML rule catalogues current · all Markdown/wiki/tree/anchor targets resolve · universal HTML deterministic, self-contained, equal-pane, independently scrollable, live-routed and script-parse checked · `git diff --check` PASS · `npm run cairn-check` OK with one expected regenerated-`ACTIVE.md` advisory · `npm run typecheck` PASS · product suite 78 files, 1,101 passed / 1 skipped · `npm run build` PASS |
| Widening (S07f) | `writes:` gained `tools/cairn-active.test.mjs` for blocked/ready live-path projection; `tools/cairn-spec-build.mjs` for deterministic Markdown-to-universal-HTML generation; and `package.json` for the explicit `cairn-spec:build` command |
| User review rule (S07f) | If a delivery is meant to be tested by the user, it remains an uncommitted, unpushed candidate until the user explicitly passes it. After that pass, commit and immediate push form the completed remote checkpoint |
| Corrections (S07e) | **2026-08-25, owner** — S07c and S07d superseded. Two differently directed documents shared one design system instead of receiving a new pedagogical one; the downward version reduced Cairn to foundations instead of specifying Cairn top down and explaining foundations when first manipulated. Replaced by one canonical, history-free specification project and one universal three-pane reader; no alternate normative reading remains |
| Corrections (S07f specification) | **2026-08-25/26, user** — research-paper restraint replaces the artful study-desk design; precision replaces decorative artifice; every specialised IT or Cairn concept receives its own wiki article; the second reading pane is a peer object surface, not subordinate help; and the learning route builds simple ideas into complex protocol behaviour instead of presenting a cryptic downward taxonomy. The reviewed protocol corrections are integrated only after that information architecture |
| Second inspection (S07f) | **2026-08-26, user** — preserve the large visual improvement, but introduce or link every abstract term before use; make “the complete protocol” readable rather than cryptic; compare the repository map with the current Cairn repository and make it exhaustive; repair pane scrolling and cross-pane wiki loading; remove section gutters; and add only a restrained frozen-glass modernity to the flat research aesthetic. Implemented in the same uncommitted candidate; a fresh inspection is required |
| Next action | S08 — extract Cairn from Atomik: `cairn.config.json`, the generated enforcement header, `cairn-new`, and the tier-0/1 `cairn-init` seed. The v0.2 predicates land here or in a successor path, never by quietly marking a matrix row `implemented` |
| Superseded next action (S07, done) | the specification and lexicon: `docs/cairn/specification.md` (planes, the ADR-017 lifecycle by reference, the rule table generated from `cairn-check.mjs`, the blocking-rule admission test, the three enforcement tiers with tier 2 as a repository property, the CP-MVP-011/012 migration window as a property), `docs/cairn/lexicon.md` (one definition per term, each pointing at the file that enforces it; a term with no enforcing file marked aspirational), and the step-by-step operator guide carrying the optional tier-2 ruleset as a copy-paste `gh api` payload |
| Widening (S05) | `writes:` gained `docs/adr/**`, `docs/bedrock/index.md`, `docs/modules/**`, `docs/index.md`, `atomik-project/index.md` — S05 was always the OKF backfill; the declaration named only the two ADRs this path authors. Deliberate `single-truth` edit: `docs/modules/atomik-desktop.md`, one stale sentence naming the removed integrator |
| Corrections (S07c) | **2026-08-25, owner** — S07 and S07b redone. *"It needs to be universal without borrowing concept from research worlds"*: a stated possibility (this **could** reach a researcher) had been read as a specification, and the whole explanatory apparatus was built on research-world concepts, making a document that claimed to teach from zero **depend on** a background. Also: one file instead of three, alternating concept and protocol; and a new theme rather than the earlier page's house style. Analogies were **removed, not replaced** — substituting another profession's would reproduce the defect with a different dependency |
| Amendments (S07) | **2026-08-25, owner** — S07 widened from "specification and lexicon" to a three-document set with a **pedagogical** remit: a from-zero primer (`foundations.md`) for a named non-engineer audience, a normative specification that points into it, and a lexicon carrying both registers. Structure and depth chosen with the owner before writing. Adds S07b, the rendered page |
| Amendments | **2026-08-24, owner ruling 9** — S06b rescoped from "configure branch protection" to "declare the enforcement tier"; its deliverables move into S07 (specification + operator guide) and S08 (`enforcement` config field, generated header line, tier-0/1 `cairn-init`). This repository stays at tier 1, declared ([note](../sessions/2026-08-24-cp-ops-002-s06b-rescope.md)) |
| Blockers | None. S07g is a completed remote checkpoint |
| Gates at S07g | `npm run cairn-check:test` PASS, 123 protocol/specification subtests (118 → 123: retention/provisional/brief, record binding, routes/repair/non-goals, object-format identity and reconciled lifecycle, the borrowed/Cairn concept split) · `npm run cairn-spec:build` deterministic, output matches the checked-in HTML · every Markdown/wiki/tree/anchor target resolves · rule catalogues current · `npm run cairn-check` OK, no advisory · `npm run typecheck` PASS · product suite PASS · `npm run build` PASS |
| Deliberate non-implementation (S07g) | The brief said *do not implement checker rules in this pass*, and the reason survives inspection: nineteen normative changes plus their predicates in one candidate is not a reviewable work unit. Fourteen matrix rows therefore read `not implemented`, which is the honest state rather than an oversight. The failure this whole revision corrects is a document claiming a mechanism that does not exist — reproducing it in the same commit would have been the one unforgivable outcome |
| Concept budget (S07g) | Hard cap 66, at 65 before this step. Merged away: `file` → `project-memory`, `markdown` → `frontmatter` (retitled *Markdown and frontmatter*), `fetch` + `push` → `fetch-and-push`, `working-tree` → `worktree` (retitled *Working tree and worktree*). Added: `checkpoint-retention`, `provisional-commit`, `scope-digest`, `acceptance-drift`, `foundation-path`. `commit-hash` retitled *Object id* without renaming the file, so no link churn. Net 66, pinned by a test |
| ADR-018 (S07g) | Still `proposed`, and deliberately. v0.2 amends two of its operating rules — force-push after rebase, and pre-acceptance work staying unpushed — so accepting it now would ratify text that is already superseded. ADR-019 records the amendment and is also `proposed` |
| Machine-local state (S06d) | `git worktree list` holds four entries — the owner's trunk, `cp-mvp-011`, `cp-mvp-012` and this path. Ten `path/*` branches retained; `registration/cp-worktree-cleanup` deleted as merged. This transition cannot be enforced by repository CI after the checkout disappears, so `paths.md` requires it to be REPORTED, which is what this row is |
